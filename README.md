## Who is this portfolio website for?
This portfolio is ideal for graphic designers, illustrators or developers who favor a classic, monochrome aesthetic. It's specifically crafted for creatives who appreciate the timeless appeal of black and white sketches and want their online presence to echo the nuances of traditional drawing and sketching.

## Style of the Website
The "Classic Sketch" theme embraces a comic feel with a monochrome, black and white sketchy, funky theme. It incorporates funky pattern designs that give the site a dynamic and engaging visual appeal, making each visit memorable and emphasizing the artistic flair of the portfolioâ€™s owner.

## Font Choice: Montserrat
Chosen for its versatility and modern flair, Montserrat complements the black and white theme by offering clean readability and a contemporary edge that aligns well with the sketchy and artistic nature of the website.

## Color Choices
- **Primary Colors:** Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF). The stark contrast between black and white not only enhances readability but also mirrors the classic sketchbook appearance, providing a perfect backdrop for showcasing graphic artwork.
